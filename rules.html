                <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals
                    of
                    sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is
                    subject
                    to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or
                    standing.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum and
                        minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                        under 12 and older.</li>
                    <li>COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60
                        yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are
                        unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                        Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
                        the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                        leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                        required to play all their games away.</li>
                    <li>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</li>
                    <ol class="abc">
                        <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age
                            groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                        <li> U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                        <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>

                        each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each
                        game.</li>
                    <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under special circumstances,
